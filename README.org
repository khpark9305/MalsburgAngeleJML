The code for the simulation is in [[file:R/simulation.script.R]].  It runs 100 iterations of the simulation.  We used a cluster computer to run many of these in parallel.  Each iteration produces one file with the results of that iteration.  The script [[file:R/collect_results.script.R]] is used to combine these results into one big data frame.  This data frame is stored in [[file:simulation_results/results.Rda]].  The analysis is embedded in the manuscript via Knitr, see [[file:manuscript.Rnw]].  This analysis uses functions defined in [[file:R/new_etmeasures.function.R]] and [[file:R/compute_model_parameters.function.R]].  The former is also used in the simulation.  The eye-tracking data used to derive the simulation parameters are in [[file:eyetracking_data/AngeleEtAl2013.csv]] and [[file:eyetracking_data/MetznerEtAl2016.tsv]].
